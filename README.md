# Iris-dataset-technical-test
Technical test Data Science Internship

Objective: The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your proficiency in Python programming,
usage of GitHub, and SQL skills using a real-world dataset (Iris dataset). You will be working
with a dataset to perform data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Instructions:
1. GitHub Repository Setup:
o Create a github repository and add all the work.

2. Python Programming:
o Download the Iris dataset (iris.csv) and place it in the repository.
o Create a script to perform the following tasks:
• Load the Iris dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
• Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
• Implement a function calculate_statistics that calculates basic
statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for a specified column in
the dataset.
• Create a plot (using Matplotlib or Seaborn) to visualize a relevant
aspect of the data.

3. SQL Skills:
o Write SQL queries to answer the following questions (apply these questions
to the Iris dataset):
• Retrieve the top 5 rows from the dataset.
• Calculate the total number of unique values in the 'species' column.
• Find the average value of the 'sepal_length' column for each species.

4. Documentation:
o Provide a brief explanation of your approach to solving the Python and SQL
tasks.
o Document any assumptions or considerations you made during the analysis.
o Include the plot generated in the Python script and describe its insights.

Submission:
• Commit your changes to your local repository.
• Push the changes to your forked GitHub repository.
• Share the link to your forked repository and any additional instructions for reviewing
your solution.
Evaluation Criteria:
• Correctness of Python code and SQL queries.
• Clarity and organization of code.
• Quality and relevance of data analysis.
• Effective use of version control (GitHub).
• Completeness and clarity of documentation.
